This repository contains all you need to know about my research project that lasted from Su23 to Au24. This was a statistical analysis of warm dark matter models. 
To learn more about the physics, see the summary of methods and conclusions pdf called "WDM Paper GH".
To learn how I actually coded everything, look at the jupyter notebook "WDM Statistical Analysis Walkthrough"
One thing to note is that the module disSat from Dr. Stacy Kim may need to be imported by hand for everything to work. This can be extremely tedious.

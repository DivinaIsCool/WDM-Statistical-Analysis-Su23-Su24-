# Statistical analysis of warm dark matter models

This repository contains information about my research project that lasted from Summer 2023 to Summer 2024. This was a statistical analysis of warm dark matter models. 

## Methods and Conclusions

To learn more about the physics, see the summary of methods and conclusions pdf called "WDM Paper GH". 

## Code and Details

To learn how I actually coded everything, look at the jupyter notebook "WDM Statistical Analysis Walkthrough" 

Note: The module disSat from Dr. Stacy Kim may need to be imported by hand for everything to work.
